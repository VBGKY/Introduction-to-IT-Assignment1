                            complex video games using CRT tubes were developed by defense

                        <h2>First Digital Computer for playing Games</h2>
                        <p>
                            In May 1951, the NIMROD computer, created by the major UK electrical engineering and equipment firm Ferranti International was presented at
                            the Festival of Britain. Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively to play the game of NIM; this was the very 
                            first instance of a digital computer designed specifically to play a game in recorded history. <br>
                            <br>
                            NIM, which is a ancient (dating back to at least the 16th Century) two-player mathematical game of strategy, in which players take turns 
                            removing objects from distinct heaps. NIMROD could play either the traditional or "reverse" form of the game. On each turn, a player must 
                            remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap. NIM is a simple game, where you 
                            start with a number of piles of tokens. Each player in turn takes one or more tokens from any one pile, and the game continues until the 
                            last token is taken from the last pile. <br>
                            <br>
                            You cannot go past Spacewar&apos;s contribution of the first computer based video game.  A space combat video game designed and developed in 1962 
                            for the DEC PDP-1 minicomputer as display monitors with computers became more common.
