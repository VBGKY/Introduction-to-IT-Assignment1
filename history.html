                        <p>
                            The foundation for the first video games ever created was the
                            <strong><em>Cathode Ray Tube or CRT</em></strong>. Some of these early tubes, used by
                            missile defense systems starting in the late <em><strong>1940's</strong></em> were adapted
                            into simple "video" games during the 50s. By the late 1950s, more
                            complex video games using CRT tubes were developed by defense
                            based workers, while gradually increasing their level of sophistication.

                        <h2>First Digital Computer for playing Games</h2>
                        <p>
                            In May 1951, the <em><strong>NIMROD computer</strong></em>, created by the major UK electrical engineering and equipment firm Ferranti International was presented at
                            the Festival of Britain. Using a panel of lights for its display, it was designed exclusively to play the game of NIM; this was the very 
                            first instance of a digital computer designed specifically to play a game in recorded history. <br>
                            <br>
                            <em><strong>NIM</strong></em>, which is a ancient (dating back to at least the <em><strong>16th Century</strong></em>) two-player mathematical game of strategy, in which players take turns 
                            removing objects from distinct heaps. NIMROD could play either the traditional or "reverse" form of the game. On each turn, a player must 
                            remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap. NIM is a simple game, where you 
                            start with a number of piles of tokens. Each player in turn takes one or more tokens from any one pile, and the game continues until the 
                            last token is taken from the last pile. <br>
                            <br>
                            You cannot go past Spacewar&apos;s contribution of the <em><strong>first computer based</strong></em> video game.  A space combat video game designed and developed in 1962 
                            for the <em><strong>DEC PDP-1 minicomputer</strong></em> as display monitors with computers became more common.

                        <h2>First Coin-Operated Arcade Game (Rise of Arcade Machines)</h2>
                        <p>
                            The <em><strong>Early 1970's</strong></em> saw the creation of today's multi-billion dollar worldwide market for Video Games, 
                            the establishment of the Arcade Gameroom and origins of the Digital <em><strong>Out-Of-Home</strong></em> Entertainment Industry. <br>
                            <br>
                            The <em><strong>"Galaxy Game"</strong></em> is the earliest known coin-operated video arcade game.
                            It was first installed in <em><strong>September, 1971 at Stanford University</strong></em> in the Tresidder Union building, 
                            two months before the release of 
                            Computer Space, the first mass-produced video arcade game. The Galaxy Game was programmed by
                            Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck. Like Computer Space, it was a yet another version
                            of the existing <em><strong>"Spacewar!"</strong></em> video game created in the early 1960s.

                            </div>
                        <p>
                            The game cost around $20,000 to build, using a DEC PDP-11 computer and
                            a vector display terminal. The game cost 10 cents to play, or three games for
                            25 cents. Only one unit was built initially. In <em><strong>1972</strong></em>, improved hardware and processing power and 
                            allowed the expansion from four to eight consoles, allowing users to play against each other. The game 
                            remained popular on campus, with wait times for players as much as one hour, until it was
                            removed in 1979 due to damage to the game monitor screens.

                        <h2>END of Arcade Machines (A new era Begins!)</h2>
                        <p>
                            From the year 2000 onwards, arcade machines and games were seemingly impacted by the home console market.  
                            Arcade machines and arcade games were adapted to compete.  One of these changes was adding redemption and 
                            prizes that can be claimed.  <em><strong>The move from coin mechanisms to smart cards</strong></em> allowed an easier way to play and 
                            removed the need for coins which also helped increase the average number of games played by using the smart card.  
                            Further to this, new types of controllers and features were introduced that could not easily be replicated with 
                            home consoles such as adding larger rifles or guns, fishing rods, drums and other devices as part of the gameplay.
