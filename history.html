                            The foundation for the first video games ever created was the
                            Cathode Ray Tube or CRT. Some of these early tubes, used by
                            missile defense systems starting in the late 1940's were adapted
                            into simple "video" games during the 50s. By the late 1950s, more
                            complex video games using CRT tubes were developed by defense
                            based workers, while gradually increasing their level of sophistication.
