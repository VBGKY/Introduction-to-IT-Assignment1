                        <p>
                            The <em><strong>Cathode Ray Tube, or CRT</strong></em>, served as the foundation for the first video games ever made. Some of these early tubes, 
                            which were utilised by missile defence systems beginning in the <em><strong>late 1940s</strong></em>, were later modified into primitive "video" 
                            games throughout the 1950s. By the late 1950s, defense-based professionals were developing more complex video games 
                            leveraging CRT tubes, gradually increasing their degree of sophistication.

                        <h2>First Digital Computer for playing Games</h2>
                        <p>
                            The <em><strong>NIMROD</strong></em> computer, developed by the popular UK electrical engineering and technology firm Ferranti International, 
                            was unveiled at the <em><strong>Festival of Britain in May 1951</strong></em>. It was the first instance in recorded history of a digital computer 
                            intended only to play a game. It used a panel of lights for its display and was designed primarily to play the game <em><strong>NIM</strong></em>. <br>
                            <br>
                            NIM is an old (going back at least to the 16th century) <em><strong>two-player mathematical strategy game</strong></em> in which players take turns 
                            removing objects from various heaps. NIMROD could play the game in either standard or "reverse" mode. On each turn, a player 
                            must remove at least one object and may remove an unlimited number of things as long as they all originate from the same heap. 
                            NIM is a straightforward game in which you begin with a number of heaps of tokens. Each player takes one or more tokens from 
                            any one pile in turn, and the game continues until the last token is taken from the last pile. <br>
                            <br>
                            <em><strong>Spacewar's</strong></em> contribution of the first computer-based video game cannot be disregarded. As computer display monitors became 
                            increasingly common, a space combat video game was planned and built in <em><strong>1962 for the DEC PDP-1</strong></em> minicomputer.

                        <h2>First Coin-Operated Arcade Game (Rise of Arcade Machines)</h2>
                        <p>
                            The early <em><strong>1970s</strong></em> witnessed the birth of today's multibillion-dollar global video game business, the emergence of the arcade gameroom, 
                            and the beginnings of the <em><strong>Digital Out-Of-Home</strong></em> Entertainment Industry. <br>
                            <br>
                            The first known coin-operated video arcade game is called <em><strong>"Galaxy Game"</strong></em>. Two months before the release of Computer Space, the first 
                            mass-produced video arcade game, it was initially placed at Stanford University at the Tresidder Union building in September 1971. 
                            <em><strong>Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck</strong></em> worked on the programming for <em><strong>The Galaxy Game</strong></em>. It was a further iteration of the already-existing "Spacewar!" 
                            video game developed in the early 1960s, much like Computer Space.

                        <p>
                            The game's development cost roughly <em><strong>$20,000, with a DEC PDP-11</strong></em> computer and a vector display interface being used. The game costs 
                            ten cents to play, or three games for twenty-five cents. Initially, only one unit was manufactured. In 1972, better hardware and 
                            computing power enabled the expansion from four to eight consoles, allowing players to compete against one another. The game remained 
                            popular on campus, with wait times of up to an hour for players, until it was removed in <em><strong>1979</strong></em> owing to damage to the game monitor screens.

                        <h2>END of Arcade Machines (A new era Begins!)</h2>
                        <p>
                            The home console industry seems to have an impact on arcade machines and games beginning in the year 2000.  
                            To compete, arcade machines and <em><strong>arcade games were modified</strong></em>.  One of these adjustments was the addition of 
                            redemption and prizes that could be claimed. The transition from coin systems to smart cards made it easier 
                            to play and eliminated the need for coinage, which also increased the average number of games played by 
                            utilising the smart card. <br>
                            Furthermore, <em><strong>new types of controllers and features were created</strong></em> that could not be 
                            easily replicated with home consoles, such as the use of larger rifles or firearms, fishing rods, drums, and 
                            other devices as part of the gameplay. But gradually, the home consoles took over and the arcade machines 
                            lost their popularity.
