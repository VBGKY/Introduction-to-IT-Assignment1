Pac-Man must avoid being eaten by the four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde) as they chase him through a maze of dots. The objective of the maze game is to consume all of the dots while avoiding the ghosts. When Pac-Man consumes a power pellet, the game is temporarily altered so that he can pursue and eat the ghosts for extra points. The uniqueness of Pac-Man lies in the fact that it combines ease of use with strategic depth. Anyone can pick up a joystick and play, but true mastery requires practise and expertise. Pac-Man's worldwide appeal stemmed from its simple design and high skill ceiling. Cultural Impacts
